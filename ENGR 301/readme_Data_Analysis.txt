I model the net energy output of a powerplant using 4 measurable variables: 
Ambient Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Exhaust Vacuum, and Relative Humidity.

The goal was to make a model and to find the highest net output while keeping to OSHA restrictions 
and keeping in mind the corrosion of the machines due to the water and oxygen molecules in the air.
